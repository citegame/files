### Modeling Strategic Interactions
Game theory aims to model strategic interactions between rational decision-makers. It assumes every player will pursue their own self interest. Payoffs depend on the decisions of all players involved in the game. Foundational work was done by John von Neumann and Oskar Morgenstern in 1944 to develop the mathematical foundations of game theory and its application to economics. They introduced the idea of a strategy, the minimax idea, equilibrium points in games, and cooperative games.

### Cooperative vs Non-Cooperative Approaches
Non-cooperative game theory models situations where binding agreements cannot be made between players. It focuses on Nash equilibrium as the prediction of behavior, where each player adopts the optimal strategy given the other playersâ€™ strategies. Cooperative game theory allows for bargaining and formation of coalitions between players. It analyzes how gains from cooperation can be divided fairly between players through concepts like the core and the Shapley value.

### Classic Examples: Prisoner's Dilemma and Coordination Games  
The Prisoner's Dilemma famously demonstrates that cooperation is not a dominant strategy, even if it yields higher collective payoffs. Each player has an incentive to defect from cooperation no matter what the other player does. Coordination games show the importance of common knowledge - multiple Nash equilibria exist and players need shared understandings to coordinate on the same optimal equilibrium. 

### Revealing Strategies through Auctions
Auction theory models competitive bidding environments and reveals optimal strategies. In first-price sealed-bid auctions, the weakly dominant strategy is to bid one's value. Whereas in English auctions, the optimal strategy is to stay in the auction until the current bid meets or exceeds private valuation. These insights explain the mechanics and outcomes of art sales and other competitive bidding processes.

### Modeling Oligopoly Competition
Game theory provides a useful framework to model strategic interactions between firms in oligopolistic industries. The famous duopoly models of Cournot and Bertrand competition predict equilibrium outputs and prices based on assumptions about firms' ability to commit to quantities or prices. Extensions incorporate more complex factors like product differentiation, collusion and dynamic competition over time.

### Analyzing International Trade Negotiations  
Repeated trade negotiations between self-interested countries can be modeled as iterative games. The theory sheds light on incentives for cooperation versus defection. It predicts circumstances under which countries will reach and comply with trade agreements versus resorting to protectionism. The stability of international trade cooperation depends sensitively on factors like power asymmetries and openness to retaliatory threats.

### Voting Behavior and Legislatures  
Legislative bargaining and voting can be understood through non-cooperative models of policy adoption games. The theory suggests incentives for logrolling and vote trading exist due to multidimensional policy preferences. Equilibrium behavior also depends on procedural rules and power asymmetries between political parties and individual legislators. Spatial models further predict swings in public opinion and voting on the left-right ideological spectrum.

### Alliance Formations in International Relations
Coalitional game theory provides insights into alliance dynamics in international relations. The theory explores how the formation of coalitions affects bargaining power and incentives for countries to join or defect from blocks like NATO. Concepts like the Shapley value and Banzhaf power index quantify countries' contributions to alliances and predict stability based on relative power shares within coalitional structures.

### Evolution of Cooperation and Signaling Strategies  
Game theory helps explain the evolution of cooperative behaviors that are not immediately self-serving. Evolutionary stable strategies, reciprocity and repeated interactions offer possibilities for cooperation to emerge from individual selection. The theory also models the evolution of signaling strategies in animal behaviors like mate choice, as signals need to be reliable for communication to function. These dynamics can explain stable coexistence of competing species. 

### Optimizing Collaborations and Decision Making
Workplace collaborations on projects involve coordination dilemmas that can be addressed using game theoretic tools. Optimal strategies exist for fairly dividing credit and work allocations between colleagues with interdependent contributions. Meanwhile, models of bargaining and veto player theorems provide guidance for collective decision making within families on major life choices. 

### Advances and Open Questions
Current extensions incorporate imperfect information through signaling games and explore dynamics under uncertainty. Algorithmic applications aim to design mechanisms for fair group decision making. Neuroeconomics applies theories to human decision making behavior and seeks biological foundations. Overall, while much progress has been made, further empirical testing and development is still needed, especially regarding modeling complex strategic interactions in emerging fields.
