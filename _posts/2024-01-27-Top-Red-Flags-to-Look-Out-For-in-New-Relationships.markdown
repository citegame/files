### What Are Deal Breakers?
Deal breakers are those things in a relationship that you simply cannot accept or tolerate. They go against your core values, expectations, or compatibility with a partner. If a deal breaker is present, it will make you deeply unhappy or uncomfortable in the relationship. Deal breakers are issues that cannot be compromised on—either the problem behavior stops, or the relationship ends. Some common examples of deal breakers include infidelity, disrespect, addiction issues, irreconcilable differences in priorities or lifestyle, and abuse of any kind.

### Common Deal Breaker Red Flags 
One sign that a relationship may not be healthy or compatible is if a partner frequently compares your body to others. Making hurtful comments about your weight, appearance or physique on multiple occasions is a red flag. Another common issue is a partner who is perpetually "too busy" to make consistent time for quality intimacy and conversations with you. Joking about or putting down your looks should also not be tolerated. A big privacy red flag is someone who cannot keep secrets—they may tell all your private information to others without consent. Chronic gossiping about you to friends behind your back is also unhealthy relationship behavior.

### Additional Deal Breaker Red Flags
Insulting or speaking badly about an ex in a bitter, angry or obsessive way can be a red flag, as it may indicate they have unresolved issues. A partner who generally seems uninterested in your opinions, feelings or life is not fully invested in the relationship. Blaming a partner for relationship or intimacy problems that they did not cause is unfair and hurtful. Lacking respect for personal boundaries is also problematic. Only asking for favors from a partner while not reciprocating or contributing equally is selfish and unhealthy relationship behavior.

### Relationship Isolating Behaviors  
Be wary of partners who pressure or coerce you into activities, behaviors or level of physical intimacy that make you uncomfortable. Isolating a partner from close family and friends through control, manipulation or jealousy is a serious red flag—healthy relationships allow each person to maintain outside support systems. Lying, hiding information or being deliberately secretive with a partner erodes trust. Gaslighting, which is manipulating someone into questioning their own reality or perceptions, is a form of emotional abuse and should not be tolerated.

### Red Flags from a Dating Experience
Overcommunicating constantly before even meeting someone in person can be a sign of attachment or intimacy issues. Dismissing or ignoring a partner's expressed relationship needs, wants or priorities is disrespectful. Any criminal history involving violence or sexual assault is, of course, an absolute deal breaker for an incompatible or unsafe relationship.

### Personal Experience Red Flags
During a past relationship, my partner would frequently make unwanted comparisons between my body and celebrities or other women. They seemed to only value physical attraction and intimacy, making little effort for quality time together otherwise. Hurtful "jokes" that put me down were also an issue. A girlfriend I had once did not respect my request to keep private matters between us private, and would tell others details I was not comfortable with sharing more widely. Another ex would often blame intimacy issues on me, when he clearly had personal problems he did not want to address or work on in therapy. 

### Additional Problematic Behaviors
Being unwilling or unable to respect a partner's emotional or physical boundaries indicates a lack of care, respect or control issues. Drastic, frequent or unexplained mood changes and anger can be destabilizing and emotionally taxing. Using put-downs, insults or name-calling during disagreements or arguments is verbally abusive. Maintaining unnecessary secrecy about normal, everyday things like schedules or spending habits can damage intimacy and trust over time due to a lack of transparency. 

### Trust Your Gut Feelings
If you find yourself frequently feeling worried, scared or upset by a partner's words or actions, pay attention to those inner warning signs. A deal breaker is something that cannot be accepted or compromised on for the long-term health of the relationship. It's perfectly okay, and even important, to have personal limits and boundaries—you deserve to feel respected and comfortable in your relationships. 

### When to End a Relationship
Prioritizing your own safety and emotional well-being should be top priorities when issues arise. Do not feel any obligation to accept or "work through" problematic behaviors that compromise these things. If you've communicated your boundaries clearly and the behaviors persist, it may be time to consider ending things. Give yourself the chance at a loving partnership where you are truly valued, treated well and feel secure.

# Trusting Your Intuition About Red Flags

Throughout my dating life, I've learned the hard way to pay attention when my intuition senses that something is off about a potential partner. The earlier red flags I overlooked usually stemmed from disrespect of my boundaries or prioritizing physical attraction over truly getting to know me.  

In healthier relationships since, I've found that respect, communication and compatibility on core values create the strongest foundation. It's not about being perfect—we all have room for growth. But how someone responds when an issue arises is revealing. Do they own their mistakes, or deflect and blame? Compromise, or dismiss your feelings?

Often, our gut knows best if someone lacks the self-awareness or care for us to build a nourishing partnership. Now I make time for introspection after dates, check-ins with trusted friends, and focus on aligning with a compassionate equal. Learning what I need has brought much calmer waters.

# Prioritizing Safety and Well-Being in Relationships

Nothing is more important than feeling secure with a romantic partner. This means not enduring manipulation, disrespect, boundary pushing or anything compromising your emotional or physical safety. Regrettably, it's all too easy to brush off early red flags or make excuses for concerning behaviors. 

But staying in an unhealthy dynamic normally only gets worse with time. And it prevents finding what you deserve—a loving, caring relationship built on mutual understanding and respect. So if issues have been addressed and still persist, it may be time to set loving limits. This shows compassion for yourself as well as your partner.

Ending an incompatible relationship allows both people a clean break to seek better matches. And it sets the precedent that mistreatment will not be tolerated, empowering you to attract healthy partnerships in future. Prioritizing safety and well-being may be difficult, but always choose the courageous path of self-respect. You have so much wonderfulness to offer the right person.

# Trusting in Yourself and the Process

Transitioning out of an unhealthy relationship can initially feel full of self-doubt. But it's important to believe in your worth, listen to loved ones who saw red flags you may have missed, and trust that ending things was the right choice for your well-being. 

Healing takes time. Be gentle with yourself as you process emotions and rebuild your confidence. Lean on support systems without resenting an ex. Keep busy but allow sadness waves to pass naturally. One day soon, focusing on your personal growth will nourish a renewed sense of purpose.

You have so much wonderfulness still ahead. When ready, take baby steps putting yourself back out there if you choose. This time, you now recognize unhealthy patterns and trust yourself enough to walk away sooner for your own peace of mind. But no need to rush—focus inward. Gradually, new opportunities will come.

With each experience, trust that you're learning and becoming surer of who you want by your side. Simply remaining determined to honor your soul's needs ensures that one day, you'll find the healthy love reflecting your worthiest self back to you. For now, keep faith in this beautiful journey within.

So in summary, trust your intuition about relationship red flags, prioritize safety and well-being, and have faith in yourself and the healing process as you learn and grow from each experience. You deserve to feel respected and cared for—the right match is out there waiting for the strong, empowered partner you're becoming.

# Trusting Your Intuition About Red Flags

One of the most important lessons I've learned is to always trust my intuition when it picks up on subtle red flags in new relationships. Little hints that something may be off—like disrespect of boundaries, unhealthy communication patterns or unexplained secrecy—are worth paying attention to, even if the issues seem minor at the time. 

Unfortunately, those early signals often prove prophetic if not addressed. Over time, disrespect tends to escalate without consequence while intimacy fades as true caring is replaced by control or indifference. This slowly chips away at self-worth until the unhealthy dynamic is normalized, and escaping feels impossible.

Never allow anxiety or low self-esteem convince you issues "aren't a big deal." You deserve care, honesty and empathy from a partner. If concerns persist after addressing them, it's a sign of incompatibility. Don't ignore what your intuition knows to be true deep down. Respecting yourself means having the courage to walk away from toxic attachments into freedom.

Healing may involve grief, yet choosing self-love illuminates a path of growth. With time and self-care, restored confidence will attract the healthy relationships reflecting your intrinsic value back to you. But first, learn to always place your well-being above trying to force incongruent connections. Trust that voice - it will never steer you wrong.
