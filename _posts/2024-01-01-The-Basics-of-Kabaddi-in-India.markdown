### What is Kabaddi

Kabaddi is a contact team sport that originated thousands of years ago in ancient India. Two teams take turns sending a single player, called a "raider", into the opposing team's half of the field. The objective for the raider is to tag, or touch, opposing team members before returning to their own side of the field. It requires strength, agility, swift decision making, and breath control from players.

### Basic Rules

Each team consists of seven players on the field at a time - four defenders and three raiders. One player from each team is designated as the raider. The raiding team sends their raider into the opposing team's side with the aim of tagging defenders before returning safely to their own half. The defending team tries to tackle the raider before they cross back over the halfway line. Games last around 40 minutes with short breaks in between periods of play.

### Levels of Play

The sport of kabaddi is popular at the grassroots level in schools and local communities across India where informal matches take place regularly. At a more competitive level, professional kabaddi leagues have emerged featuring city-based franchises with rosters of 12-15 players. Internationally, kabaddi is played at major multi-sport events like the Asian Games and the Kabaddi World Cup organized by the International Kabaddi Federation.

### Strategies and Techniques

To evade tackles, raiders must employ strong footwork and swift changes of direction coupled with feints and sidesteps. Defenders utilize holding techniques like ankle holds to immobilize raiders once they are within reach. Teams deploy strategic raiding and defensive formations during matches. Successful raiders analyze gaps in the defensive lineup while defenders coordinate tackles and protect vulnerable areas of the side.

### Popularity in India 

Kabaddi has deep roots in Indian history, culture and religion tracing back over 4,000 years to ancient Hindu texts like the Mahabharata which describe early forms of the sport. Today, it remains hugely popular across the country and is recognized as the national sport of states like Punjab and Tamil Nadu. The Pro Kabaddi League, launched in 2014, is now the second most-watched sports league in India behind only cricket.

### Kabaddi Around the World

While kabaddi originated and remains most popular in South Asia, especially India, interest in the sport has been growing internationally in recent decades. Countries like Iran, Korea and other Asian nations have competitive national kabaddi programs and regularly play in world championship events. Kabaddi was also included as a demonstration sport at the 1936 Berlin Olympics, helping to raise its profile outside of the subcontinent.

### India's Kabaddi Dominance

When it comes to international kabaddi competitions, India has overwhelmingly proven itself as the dominant global force. The nation has won every men's Kabaddi World Cup title since the tournament's inception in 2004 all the way up until a historic loss in the 2018 final. India has also claimed gold in every Asian Games competition since kabaddi was added to the program in 1990 - a true dynasty. They have developed remarkably talented players and are widely recognized as the global standard-bearers in the sport.

### Career Prospects

There are competitive opportunities available for elite kabaddi players to represent their state, nation and professional clubs/franchises on the domestic and international stage. The advent of professional leagues like Pro Kabaddi have created sustainable careers for top performers in the sport. Additionally, numerous young players get their start honing their skills through school, college and grassroots programs with hopes of someday progressing to the highest levels.
