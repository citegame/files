### Her Actions Towards You

She goes out of her way to show you that she cares. Small gestures like making your favorite meal, picking up something she knows you've been wanting, or taking care of tasks so you have more free time are how she lets you know she's thinking of you. She listens when you talk about your day and remembers small details you mentioned in past conversations. Making you smile is one of her top priorities.

### Changes in Her Behavior

Some of her interests have started to overlap more with yours. You've noticed she's been watching some of the same TV shows or listening to the same music you enjoy. She also mentions wanting to try a new restaurant or activity after hearing you talk about it. Little things like that show how she's incorporating you more into her daily life. 

### Emotions and Feelings

She isn't afraid to be vulnerable with you. You've seen her joyful, angry, and sad sides. She trusts you with her true emotions knowing you won't judge her for being human. Telling you "I love you" comes naturally, but she also shows it with patience during tough times. How she reacts to stressors depends greatly on how you treat her - for better or worse.

### Focus and Priorities 

Discussions about both of your futures have become more common. She wants to know your life goals and dreams, and shares her own vision that includes you. Making plans together on weekends or evenings has become a routine rather than something occasional. Keeping the conversation flowing without running out of things to say comes easily. You feel like a priority in her life.

### Physical Intimacy

While physical intimacy is an important part of your relationship, she places more value on the emotional bond you've built. Long conversations, acts of service, and quality time spent learning about each other on deeper levels are just as meaningful, if not more so, than physical touch alone. Your non-physical connection gives context and significance to your intimate moments. 

### Loyalty and Commitment  

She proves her loyalty in both words and actions each day. Discussing past relationships is a rarity - you're the one she wants to focus on for the long run. Expressing your relationship on social media or introducing you as her partner to others reflects her commitment. She takes your bond seriously and isn't secretly looking for something "better" on dating apps.

### Obsessive Thoughts

Thinking about you brings a smile to her face throughout the day. Mundane activities like commuting or doing chores become more enjoyable when she daydreams scenario's of your future together. Recalling inside jokes or terms of endearment you have specifically for each other fills her heart. Little reminders of you are cherished rather than a distraction from her to-do list. 

### Seeing through your Eyes

She tries her best to understand your perspective even when you disagree. Considering how your diverse backgrounds shape your worldview helps her offer empathy and support. Your happiness matters to her as much as her own. She continuously works on being someone who lifts you up rather than pulls you down during hard times.

### Unconditional Acceptance

For better or worse, in sickness and in health - she accepts you for who you truly are. Your flaws, mistakes, and weaknesses don't lessen her care or loyalty. She loves seeing you grow as a person but knows growth takes place gradually over the years. As long as you keep putting effort into the relationship, she has no hesitation in continuing her commitment to your bond.
