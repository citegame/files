### Standing by His Principles

A small town bank manager found himself in a difficult situation when a prominent local businessman applied for a sizable loan without proper collateral. As the manager reviewed the application, he noticed several discrepancies that concerned him. Despite pressure from the businessman and his allies on the town council, the manager upheld the bank's lending standards and declined the request. This sparked outrage and a smear campaign against the manager's reputation and job security. However, he remained steadfast in his principles of ethical and responsible lending practices. Though a difficult time, the manager's courage inspired confidence in the community that the bank operated with integrity.
