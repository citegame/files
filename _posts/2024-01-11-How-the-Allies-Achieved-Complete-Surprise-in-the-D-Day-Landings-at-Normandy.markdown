### Layers of Strategic Deception Fooled the Germans  
The Allies went to great lengths with Operation Fortitude to mislead German intelligence. Fake army units were established in southeast England complete with inflatable tanks and vehicles. These dummy forces, along with false radio communications and reconnaissance reports, tricked the Germans into believing the invasion would occur at Calais instead of Normandy.

### Normandy Was an Unexpected Target
Germany expected the invasion would take place at Calais because of its proximity to Britain. Normandy had less fortified beaches farther from strategic cities and ports. Favorable weather in early June 1944 also pointed to Normandy as the likely landing zone over other potential sites like Calais or the Pas-de-Calais.

### Rommel Underestimated the Allied Forces
Field Marshal Erwin Rommel went home to Germany just days before the invasion confident it wouldn't occur that year. Due to pressure from Hitler, he failed to strengthen defenses along Normandy's coast. Meanwhile, the Allies achieved air and naval supremacy over the English Channel and along the invasion beaches despite facing unfavorable conditions early in the campaign.

### Intense Bombardments Battered German Positions  
In the hours before troops hit the beaches, massive bombardments from Allied ships pounded fortifications along the Normandy coastline. Battleships, destroyers, and other warships provided critical fire support that helped infantry push inland from beaches like Omaha and Utah. Follow up naval bombardments destroyed reinforcement units attempting to launch counterattacks.

### Strategic Moves Stymied the Germans 
Hitler refused orders to deploy Panzer units from around Calais, falling for Allied deception hinting at a fake attack there. Destruction of bridges and roads by bombing raids severely hampered Germany's ability to rush reinforcements to Normandy effectively. Allied air superiority further limited numbers the depleted Wehrmacht could commit to the defense.

### Surprise Allowed a Foothold to Form
Initial German opposition proved lighter than anticipated after deception plans distracted the enemy. Beachhead forces accomplished their objectives ahead of schedule on D-Day while withstanding counterattack attempts. Reinforcements rapidly expanded the foothold which ultimately led to liberation of Western Europe following the successful breakout from Normandy.

### Lessons from Prior Operations Paid Off  
Allied planners fine-tuned strategies of strategic deception and bombardment power seen previously at places like Dieppe. Intelligence gathered fighting in North Africa also informed site selection and preparations for Normandy. Improved tactical transport avoided issues encountered at prior invasions such as Anzio and Salerno in rehabilitation coastal infrastructure and ferry troops inland.
