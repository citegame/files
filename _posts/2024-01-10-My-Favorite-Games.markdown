## Mario Party 10 and Call of Duty 
Mario Party 10 is one of my all-time favorite games. I spent countless hours playing it with friends and family. Wandering the colorful boards, landing on event spaces, and trying to collect the most stars keeps the game feeling fresh every time. Puzzle clues and mini games provide endless entertainment. 

Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 also holds a special place in my gaming history. The multiplayer modes like team deathmatch and search & destroy led to memorable gaming sessions. Two modes in particular, Battle Royale and DMZ, offered the most variety and replay value. Battle Royale tasks players with being the last squad surviving in a shrinking map. Meanwhile, DMZ lets you complete contracts, explore the open world, and try to exfiltrate with earned gear, creating tension filled experiences.

## Runescape and Fallout 3
Runescape has been my go-to online game for many years now. The medieval fantasy setting combined with all the quests, skills to level up, and player economy provides immense gameplay. It runs smoothly on low-end devices too, making it very accessible. 

Fallout 3 fascinated me with its post-apocalyptic Washington D.C. setting. Roaming the rubble filled capital and making choices that shape each unique playthrough kept me entertained for over 100 hours. The turn based combat and character building elements harken back to classic CRPGs. Despite its age, Fallout 3 continues delighting players with its rich atmosphere and story.

### Half-Life, Red Alert 2/3, Age of Empires, and More 
A few other games I spent a lot of time with back in the day include the original Half-Life for its atmospheric sci-fi storytelling, the Red Alert real-time strategy games which were endlessly customizable, and the beginnings of the acclaimed Age of Empires series. First person shooters like the original Call of Duty also deserve mention for helping define the genre. Plus, expansive franchises like Assassin's Creed allowed me to explore diverse historical settings. Maintaining a variety of genres in my library helps avoid burning out on any single one.

## Tomb Raider and Grand Theft Auto
Coming included with my console, the latest Tomb Raider game provided a great single player experience solving environmental puzzles and platforming through ancient ruins. Exploration and combat flowed well together making progress very satisfying.  

Grand Theft Auto remains one of the most ambitious game franchises, and I’ve spent countless hours in all the various open world cities they’ve recreated. Side activities like complete races, robberies, and managing illicit businesses provide seemingly endless gameplay. Though public lobbies can result in some unwanted mayhem, the games truly shine with friends in a private session.

## Duke Nukem 3D, Half-Life 2, and Far Cry
A few classics from PC gaming’s golden age in the late 90s and 2000s include Duke Nukem 3D for its humor and creative level design, Half-Life 2 which revolutionized storytelling and physics in shooters, and the original Far Cry that popularized open world sandbox worlds. 

However, no game from that era sticks with me quite like Contra. Teamed up with a friend, we spent hours mastering each brutally difficult stage, learning enemy patterns, and perfecting button combinations. Beating Contra together felt like a true accomplishment, a testament to the satisfying challenge these older “hardcore” titles provided.

## Shastranga and Advanced Civilization
When it comes to board games, one that stands out is Shastranga. A 4X style game akin to Civilization or Cosmic Encounter, it challenges up to six players to expand their astrological empire across planets in our solar system. Complex mechanics involving capturing opponent houses via planetary alignment create a deep strategic experience. 

Other thought-provoking strategy board games in my collection include Advanced Civilization which established many staples of the 4X genre, Space Empires 4X for multiplayer space conquest, Star Trek Ascendancy putting players in charge of iconic factions, and Eclipse with its unique tech progression through different eras. Rich gameplay and meaningful decisions are hallmarks of why I enjoy these types of games.

## Poker Nights 
While math isn't my strongest subject, I have a knack for poker that has resulted in some profitable sessions over the years. Playing Texas Hold'em, Omaha, and other variants with friends gives us an entertaining group activity. Subtle social cues and reads have served me better than crunching odds at the table. Casual casino trips have also provided thrilling distraction on occasion where beginner's luck prevailed more than once. Poker proves that the mental game can outweigh raw intellect.

## Rec Room and Superhot VR
Standing out as an indispensable VR experience is Rec Room. As a free to play game, it provides a hub world filled with user created games to enjoy across multiple platforms, even without owning a VR headset. Hours disappear exploring what the creative community has dreamt up.

Superhot VR translates the innovative "time only moves when you move" mechanic into virtual reality exceptionally well. Few games match the feeling of being an action hero ducking projectiles and punching enemies while immersed. For gaming as exercise, Beat Saber can't be beat. Its musical lightsaber slicing rhythm gameplay provides a true workout. Plus titles like Onward enable ultra realistic military simulations only VR can offer. Tool creations in Tilt Brush unleash inner artists.

## Red Dead Redemption 2 and Battlefield 2
At the very top of all non-VR games remains Red Dead Redemption 2. Its living, breathing open world of the American frontier filled with memorable characters and stories sets a new standard. Decades later and Battlefield 2 still feels groundbreaking, popularizing team based multiplayer mayhem and vehicle combat on massive maps. These two blockbusters exemplify how far interactive entertainment has come.
