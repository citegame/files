## ### The Toughness and Compartmentalization of an Aircraft Carrier

The USS America sinking experiment in 2005 showed just how resilient even an older carrier can be. Though decommissioned for nearly 30 years, it still took continuous bombardment from cruise missiles, bombs and naval gunfire to finally sink her. Nimitz-class carriers are even larger than the Kitty Hawk-class America. At over 100,000 tons full load, modern carriers incorporate additional underwater protections developments over older designs. Their hulls are divided into many watertight compartments, making them natural survivability. For a carrier to sink, thousands of gallons of seawater would need to flood enough compartments to overwhelm its buoyancy.

## ###The Firepower Needed to Destroy a Carrier

A direct hit from one of the Yamato's massive 460mm main guns would cause catastrophic damage. However, even magazine explosions may not be enough on their own due to the compartmentalization. Fires and secondary explosions from aviation fuel and munitions greatly raise the risk of the damage spiraling out of control. Careful, coordinated strikes against multiple compartments below and above the waterline would optimize the chances of sinking a fully laden carrier. Still, the defenders wouldn't make it easy, and any attack would prompt an immediate response.

## ###Learning from Accidents and Minor Combat Damage  

Even relatively small initial damages can cascade if not contained promptly. The 1967 fire aboard USS Forrestal demonstrated how an accidental launch of a Zuni rocket sparked a tragedy. Similarly, HMS Sheffield suffered a broken back after two Exocet missile hits in the Falklands War. In both cases, the initial impacts may have been survivable with optimal damage control responses. Being overwhelmed allowed minor problems to overwhelm the ships. A foe need not achieve a precision kill shot but instead trigger failure cascades through the carrier's compartments.

## ###The Endurance of Nuclear Power

The USS Enterprise served for an incredible 55 years from 1961 to 2017, proving the endurance of aircraft carrier designs. Only decommissioned due to age rather than obsolescence, the "Big E" could have likely given even longer service. Modern Nimitz-class carriers are powered by twin nuclear reactors expected to allow 40-50 years or more of operation before refueling. With periodic upgrades, retrofits, and maintenance availabilities, there is no reason carriers built today could not match and even exceed the Big E's extraordinary career length.

## ###Underwater Threats and Carrier Defenses

Submarines pose a severe threat to carriers and amphibious shipping. However, attacking a nuclear-powered supercarrier and its escorts carries enormous risks for any submarine commander. Carriers operate surrounded by layers of protective surface ships and aircraft with advanced sensors maintaining anti-submarine warfare superiority. Even next-generation torpedoes might struggle to penetrate defenses to attain a lethal hit alone. Coordinated multi-axis attacks present the greatest chance for submariners but are also the hardest to execute against such a formidable defended task force.

## ###Emerging Challenges and Adaptations 

Progress on hypersonic and long-range anti-ship missiles increase dangers to surface fleets. Defenses are actively adapting with new interceptor missiles, decoys and electronic warfare. Mass drone attacks could also threaten carriers if coordinated en masse. However, developing robust countermeasures to such emerging threats remains a top priority. Aircraft carriers still offer immense power projection and persist due to difficulties facing any direct adversary. Their defensive networks will only grow more sophisticated ensuring carriers stay dominant for the foreseeable future of modern naval combat.


## ###The Enduring Relevance of Aircraft Carriers

Claims of carriers' coming obsolescence typically stem from parties seeking increased funding for favored alternative weapons. However, no nation wants direct military confrontation with America's unparalleled carrier strike groups. As difficult as ever to destroy, modern flattops carry growing airwing capabilities with every tech cycle. Strategically, they remain supremely flexible chess pieces that any smart leadership keeps off any opponent's target lists. Barring truly game-changing technologies, carriers will endure for decades more as the dominant power projection tool of the world's leading navies.
