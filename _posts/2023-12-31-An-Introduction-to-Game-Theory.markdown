## What is Game Theory
Game theory is a strategic decision-making framework that analyzes how individuals make optimal choices while considering others' decisions. It was introduced in 1944 by John von Neumann and Oskar Morgenstern to mathematically study economic and political competition in situations involving multiple decision-makers. Game theory assumes that individuals are rational actors seeking to maximize their payoffs. 

## Types of Games
### Cooperative Games
Cooperative games assume players can communicate and form legally binding agreements before and during gameplay. This allows coalitions and alliances to be formed for mutual benefit. Solutions concepts like the Core and Shapley value help analyze how gains from cooperation are distributed among coalition members.

### Non-Cooperative Games 
Non-cooperative games do not allow pre-play communication or enforceable agreements between players. Each individual acts solely to maximize their own payoffs based on the strategic environment and choices of others. This leads to the notion of Nash equilibrium as the logical outcome of non-cooperative strategic situations.

## Famous Examples
### The Prisoner's Dilemma
This classic game illustrates the tension between individual incentive and collective optimal outcomes. It shows two suspects who could either confess or stay silent during police interrogation. No matter what the other player does, the dominant strategy for each is to confess, which paradoxically leads to a collectively worse result than remaining silent.

### Other Classics
Other examples that helped establish game theory include Battle of the Sexes, where couple has disagreeing preferences on date activities; Stag Hunt where cooperation is needed to achieve higher payoff; and Centipede Game which studies backward induction leading to non-cooperative outcomes. These highlighted strategic interdependence and the role of equilibrium concepts.

## Equilibrium Concepts 
### Nash Equilibrium
Put forward by John Nash in 1950, this is an outcome of a non-cooperative game where no player benefits by unilaterally changing their strategy while others' choices remain unchanged. It provides prediction of outcomes in the absence of binding agreements.

### Subgame Perfect Equilibrium
A refinement of Nash equilibrium proposed by Reinhard Selten in 1965. It requires strategies to be in equilibrium at every decision node, implying players rationally anticipate how others will react to their moves throughout the game tree using backward induction. 

## Cooperative Game Theory
### Coalition Formation
Cooperative theory analyzes how groups, or coalitions, of players may benefit by coordinating their actions. It studies how the total value created by all players cooperating in the grand coalition is divided up among members.

### Solution Concepts
Prominent solution concepts in cooperative theory include the Core, specifying payoff allocations no coalition can block; and Shapley value, quantifying each player's marginal contribution fairly. They provide benchmarks for evaluating cooperation and suggesting equitable distributions.

## Applications of Game Theory
### Economics
Game theory revolutionized economics by bringing strategic considerations to situations of interdependent decision making in industries, markets and other multi-agent scenarios. It helps explain pricing games, auctions, oligopolistic competition.

### Beyond Economics
Other disciplines widely using game theory include political science to analyze voting systems, alliances and strategic policy-making. Biology employs evolutionary game theory to study animal behavior and emergence of social norms. Computer science applies it to cybersecurity, algorithmic mechanism design and network effects.

## Beyond Classic Games
### Repeated Games
Allowing indefinite future play introduces considerations like reputation, trust and reciprocity into otherwise one-shot games. Finitely repeated Prisoner's Dilemma can lead to more cooperative equilibrium outcomes than its single-shot version through the shadow of future.

### Imperfect Information
Many real world scenarios involve missing, hidden or uncertain information. Signaling games analyze how uninformed players infer others' private information from their observable actions/signals. Bayesian games incorporate subjective probabilistic beliefs into strategies. 

### Evolutionary Game Theory
Pioneered by John Maynard Smith, this applies Darwinian natural selection to games. It studies how strategic interactions between phenotypes spread in a population over generations according to their fitness. Evolutionary Stable Strategies are equilibrium outcomes immune to invasion by alternative strategies.

## Criticisms and Limitations
### Rationality Assumptions
Game theory's core premise of rational payoff maximization has been questioned for not accurately capturing real human decision making affected by bounded rationality, emotions, social preferences and heuristics.

### Enforcing Cooperation
While cooperative theory offers analytical tools, implementing stable cooperative outcomes faces difficulties in lack of enforcement mechanisms to deter defection in absence of binding agreements between self-interested players.

## The Future of Game Theory
### New Applications
Algorithmic game theory brought algorithm design under strategic lens. Deep learning based approaches now apply game theoretic concepts like Nash equilibria to train multi-agent systems. Exploration of broader social, organizational and biological contexts continues expanding applications.  

### Interdisciplinarity
Ever stronger connections are being forged between game theory and various social sciences. Progress relies on feedback between new empirical evidence on human strategic behavior and theoretical model refinements to capture richer aspects of interactive decision making. Game theory remains a vibrant, actively evolving field of enquiry.
