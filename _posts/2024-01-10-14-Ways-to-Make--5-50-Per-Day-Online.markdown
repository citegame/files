### Surveys Can Earn You Extra Cash
Taking surveys can be a quick and easy way to earn some extra money. Many survey sites such as Survey Junkie and Swagbucks allow users to take surveys on various topics in exchange for payment ranging from a few cents to a few dollars each. Focusing on survey sites can potentially earn $5-20 per day from the convenience of your home. Surveys generally only take 5-10 minutes each to complete and cover a wide variety of topics. Be sure to verify payments are being received as promised before dedicating too much time to any one site.

### Sell Your Unused Items Online
Instead of letting unused items collect dust around your home, consider selling them online for some quick cash. Platforms like eBay, Facebook Marketplace, and Amazon offer great opportunities to declutter while earning from things you no longer need. Search your home for quality items in good condition you can list for sale. Research completed sales of similar items to list a competitive price. This can potentially earn a few extra dollars each week with minimal ongoing effort after initial setup.

### Complete Small Online Tasks for Quick Pay
Microwork websites allow users to complete small online tasks such as data entry, surveys, watching videos, and website testing for quick monetary rewards. Platforms like Amazon Mechanical Turk, Clickworker, and Swagbucks offer microtasks paying a few cents to a couple dollars each. Tasks generally take only a few minutes to complete and cover a wide variety of topics. Focus on completing tasks regularly to earn $5-30 per day with minimal time commitments. Be wary of any sites requiring an upfront investment before getting paid. Stick with reputable platforms to minimize risks.

### Freelance Your Talents Online
If you have any marketable skills or talents, consider offering freelance services online. Platforms like Fiverr, Upwork, and Freelancer connect clients worldwide with freelancers for a variety of projects. You can offer services such as writing, web design, social media management, virtual assistance, and more to start building clientele and earning an ongoing income. Signing up is generally free, and you get to choose which projects interest you. Carefully manage expectations, deliver high-quality work, and develop a strong portfolio to attract high-paying long-term clients. This has the potential to become quite lucrative as your reputation and experience grows.

### Generate Passive Income from Affiliate Marketing
Promoting other companies' products through affiliate marketing programs is a largely passive way to earn supplemental income online. Join affiliate programs from popular retailers like Amazon, Walmart, eBay, and ClickBank by signing up through their websites. Then promote featured products to your network through blog posts, emails, social media, product reviews and more. Get paid a commission for each sale referred through your unique tracking links. With some initial effort generating quality content around different niches, this strategy has the potential to bring in ongoing earnings with minimal active work.

### Create & Sell Online Courses for Residual Income
Another idea for earning ongoing income after an initial setup period is creating and selling online courses. If you have expert knowledge or experience in a particular field, consider developing educational content and selling your self-paced video course through platforms like Udemy, Thinkific or Teachable. Courses normally sell for $10-200 each, and you receive a royalty each time your course is purchased. Courses provide an opportunity to generate passive income for significant time after initially developing and listing your content for sale online. Promote your course through all available channels to build an audience. Courses can become very lucrative if done well.

### Participate in Paid Online User Interviews
Sites like Respondent and Survey Junkie recruit participants for market research studies paying $50-200 for one to two hour online interview sessions. Qualify for interviews matching your demographics and interests by completing detailed profiles describing your background, attributes, and preferences. Selected projects may involve user testing software, giving your perspectives on products/services, or participating in group discussion sessions. Though not offered daily, these higher paying assignments provide an opportunity to earn more in a short amount of time versus surveys alone. Maintain activity on available platforms for invitation notifications as studies come available.

### Monetize a Blog by Building an Audience
With some time and effort developing quality content around a specific topic or niche, starting a blog can become a source of supplemental or even full-time income. Monetize a blog through ads, affiliate marketing commissions, sponsored post promotions, selling merchandise, or digital products over time. Focus on creating engaging and informative posts published on a consistent schedule to develop an audience that keeps coming back. Interact regularly in relevant online communities and grow followers across social networks to promote your content. Maintain analytics to understand reader behavior and improve content based on what they respond to best. With months and years, building a sizable audience gives passive income potential through diversified blog monetization strategies.

### Walk Dogs or Sit Pets for Extra Cash
If you enjoy animals, sites like Rover and Care.com connect pet owners needing boarding, daycare, walking services with trusted sitters. Create a profile showcasing your experience and love for pets, then advertise your services in your local area at competitive rates. Be responsive, responsible, and reliable to develop a loyal client base that returns for all their pet care needs. Even taking on just a couple regular jobs each week has the potential to earn $5-20 extra daily. You get to play with furry friends while making some supplemental income on your schedule too. Keep client interactions positive for great word-of-mouth referrals.

### Complete Odd Jobs Locally for Quick Cash
General labor platforms like TaskRabbit, Amazon Flex, and Instacart connect individuals needing help around town with capable â€˜taskers' providing services. Sign up to run errands, assist with small household jobs, furniture assembly, rides to appointments, and more. Many jobs pay $5-20 each based on skill level and ratings. Downloads tasks nearby to hustle and earn same-day cash as availability allows between other commitments. An afternoon spent completing jobs via these apps may earn $30-50 extra. Remain responsive and conscientious to build positive reviews for the opportunity of repeat customers and steady work over time.

That covers several straightforward strategies for motivated individuals to potentially earn anywhere from $5-50 per day with just a few hours spent online or completing local tasks. Most options have the potential for supplementary or even full-time income with consistent effort over time optimizing skills and building client bases. Always research opportunities thoroughly before dedicating significant hours, and maintain quality across all work completed.
