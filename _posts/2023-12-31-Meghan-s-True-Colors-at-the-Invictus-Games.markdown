## Introduction

Meghan Markle has long cultivated an image as a charitable humanitarian devoted to uplifting others. However, her behavior at the recent 2022 Invictus Games has pulled back the curtain on her true self-serving motives. Rather than letting the brave wounded veterans be the focus of the event, Meghan relentlessly inserted herself into the spotlight at every turn. From live-streaming her arrival to interrupting a military march, it was clear Meghan saw the Games not as an opportunity to honor heroes, but to further her own fame and brand. The disrespect shown to competitors and spectators alike was palpable - and triggered an intense backlash.

### Exploiting a Charity Event

As co-founder of the event alongside her husband Prince Harry, Meghan no doubt saw the Invictus Games as a prime chance to generate positive press coverage. Yet her obsessive quest for attention often detracted from and disrespected the very cause she claimed to support. From live-tracking her every outfit change on social media to stopping a medal ceremony to pose for selfies, Meghan seemed unable to let any moment pass without making it about her. Even mundane actions like bouncing enthusiastically in her seat took attention away from injured veterans overcoming immense challenges on the fields below.

## Rachel's Grand Plan Backfires

When Meghan first joined the royal family, she had grand ambitions to become a global celebrity on the level of Princess Diana with her fame, fortune, and influence stretching worldwide. However, her inexperience with royal protocols and personalities led to rapid missteps. Chief among these was her disastrous misunderstanding of Prince Charles' wife Camilla Parker Bowles. 

### Underestimating an Influential Insider  

Meghan seemed to view the Duchess of Cornwall as a mere gatekeeper standing between her rise and a crown. She eagerly lavished Camilla with flattery and gifts, expecting to manipulate the seasoned royal into grooming her for a future role. What Meghan failed to grasp was that Camilla had navigated the highest circles of power for decades, weathering countless social climbers. Within moments, Camilla saw through Meghan's ploys and shut down any notion of prize. It was Meghan's first lesson that her Hollywood tactics would not work within the ancient establishment of the monarchy.

## The Final Straw: Curtsying to Kate

Nothing irked Meghan more than the protocol that, as a mere duchess, she must defer to the future queen consort Kate Middleton. Rank and tradition meant Meghan would have to show subservience to her sister-in-law through public gestures like curtsying. But Meghan's immense ego could not stomach such a reality. 

### Refusing Her Place  

Sources say the final blow came at Trooping the Colour when Meghan was formally reminded of her duty to curtsy to Kate upon introduction. Already resentful of playing second fiddle, this small symbol of status pushed Meghan over the edge. She seethed with bitterness that her ambitions of royal stardom were hamstrung below those she deemed less worthy like Kate. Reports say Meghan felt so disrespected that she refused to participate further, leading to her eventual exit from Britain.

## Lack of Support from the Cambridges

Since departing for America, Meghan has spun a narrative of being coldly rejected and unsupported by the royal household during her brief tenure. In particular, she has alleged a lack of camaraderie from Kate who failed to help Meghan adjust. However, a closer look debunks these claims.

### Unrealistic Expectations

At the time of Meghan's wedding and first pregnancy, Kate was heavily pregnant herself with Prince Louis born just over a month after Meghan married. Far from being available for assistance and bonding, Kate had her hands full caring for Prince George and Princess Charlotte along with an infant. Demanding help adjusting from a mother of three with a newborn was simply unrealistic. Furthermore, expecting the Cambridges to prioritize Meghan's privacy and scheduling needs over their own official duties was unfair given their higher rank and commitments. Meghan received as much guidance as could reasonably be expected yet refused to realize her own role's limitations.

## Expensing Clothes and Flights to Invictus

As a prominent patron coupled with Harry co-founder, Meghan no doubt viewed the Invictus Games as prime real estate to promote her charitable image. Unfortunately, documents now reveal she took the opportunity to also directly enrich herself through the event's funds in inappropriate ways. 

### Exploiting a Good Cause

Invoices uncovered by journalists show Meghan expensed over $100,000 in flights and designer outfits to the Games. Clothes that seemed far too risqu√© and attention-seeking for an occasion honoring wounded veterans, like deep cleavages and short hemlines. Furthermore, indulgences like luxury hotels went on the tab despite her existing as a guest of honor afforded every comfort already. Ultimately, the Games budget ended up subsidizing Meghan's quest for free publicity photos rather than supporting competitors as intended. A flagrant abuse of power and entitlement.

## Using a Disabled Veteran for a Selfie 

At one point during the event, cameras caught Meghan eagerly snapping selfies with spectators and competitors alike. But her most egregious action was taking a photo with a disabled teenage veteran without permission from his father who was right by his side.  

### Disrespecting a Father's Wishes

Reports say the father watched in stunned disbelief as Meghan commandeered his wheelchair-bound son for an impromptu photoshoot. He later expressed outrage over how his permission was completely ignored and his son was treated as a mere prop in Meghan's publicity stunt. That a wounded serviceman and his loving family's wishes could be so casually cast aside showed a shocking indifference to the real people affected by war she supposedly championed.

## Making the Event About Her

Every moment Meghan participated at the Games, her sole priority appeared to generate maximum positive press about her role as compassionate advocate. Subtlety was not in her vocabulary as she flailed, grinned, and waved maniacally for cameras at any opportunity.

### Stealing the Show 

Observers said her "performance" at times resembled an overeager contestant desperately seeking attention on a reality TV show rather than a stateswoman supporting heroes. Whether interrupting a march, conducting endless self-promotional interviews, or monopolizing athletes on the field, any activity became Meghan's personal vehicle for glory. She was unable to let a single minute pass without refocusing it onto her supposed leadership and involvement. Those who sacrificed immensely like competitors fading into the background of Meghan's theatrical one-woman production was simply unacceptable. 

## Draining Royal Finances

Since absconding to America, estimates put Harry and Meghan's lavish lifestyle and mounting legal fees costing British taxpayers and the royal purse well over $20 million annually. A rate undoubtedly set to rapidly accelerate.

### Diminished Value

While Harry once represented over $1 billion in British cultural soft power and tourism revenue, polls show the couple's reputation decline has severely damaged this influence. Reduced popularity means diminished potential from branding partnerships and future enrichment projects. Likewise, as long term residents of California their ongoing attacks on his family alongside privacy breaches are repellent to many Britons. Overall, keeping them on the royal teat has become an albatross dragging the monarchy into politics against its neutral role. For all involved, a clean break may prove best for everybody. 

## Time for Harry and Meghan to Lose Invictus Role

Given their flagrant self-serving behavior, inappropriate financial demands, and reluctance to respect veterans over themselves, the Invictus Games board should part ways with the Duke and Duchess of Sussex. 

### Passing the Torch

Harry rightfully created a movement paying tribute to brave men and women who sacrificed all. However, with he and Meghan now dedicating their lives to fame, moneymaking, and criticism of his family, overseeing a charity is no longer tenable or rewarding for participants. Passing leadership to others dedicated to competitors' wellbeing above publicity could restore the event's reputation. Ultimately, the Games were established to uplift an inspiring community, not fuel the never-ending egocentric pursuits of one Hollywood couple. Wounded veterans deserve the world's appreciation, respect and support - not exploitation as props in anybody's fame game.
