## Understanding Writer's Block
Writer's block is often a sign that the story has gone off track or the characters are doing something they wouldn't. To fix it, go back to the beginning and read through to find where it feels wrong, then delete from there. It may also mean not fully understanding your own story - give your brain time to work through it. 

When we're stuck in our writing, it's usually because something isn't working internally within the story or with our characters. The key is to go back to the beginning and analyze where things started to feel off or inauthentic. Don't be afraid to hit delete and start over from that point. Writer's block can also stem from a lack of clarity around our own stories and ideas. Give your brain some time and space to flesh things out more fully before pushing through.

## Changing Perspectives
Temporarily focusing on something else like a video game can give your brain a break and the words will start flowing again after. Writing something else, like nonfiction, can also help break the logjam on a difficult piece. Collaborating with a co-author by discussing ideas can spark new perspectives neither would think of alone.

When we get stuck in a rut creatively, it can help to switch things up temporarily. Taking a break from the story that's giving you trouble, whether it's to play a video game, work on a different writing project, or discuss ideas with a friend, can give your brain the refresh it needs. Stepping away provides a change in perspective so you come back with new eyes. Collaborating with others through an exchange of ideas is also beneficial, as multiple minds together can inspire thoughts neither would arrive at on their own.

### Embracing Flexibility
Not every writing session will be perfect - it's about making progress, not perfection. Creativity ebbs and flows, so accepting this is crucial. Nurturing curiosity by reading diverse content and observing the world can inspire new ideas. Small achievable goals can help regain momentum when stuck.

We have to allow for flexibility in our writing process and expectations. Not every session at the keyboard will result in pure gold. What's important is continuing to make progress, even if it's just a little at a time. Creativity waxes and wanes, so we must accept that and roll with it. Fueling our curiosity through diverse reading material and taking time to observe the world around us keeps the wellspring of ideas flowing. When momentum lags, setting smaller, achievable daily goals can help get it back on track.

## The Benefits of Self-Publishing
While getting started with self-publishing may seem daunting, breaking it down into simple steps like outlined in a free checklist makes the process easy. After publishing over 200 books on Amazon and running ads, learning the key is to find the right niche and promote effectively.

At first glance, the undertaking of self-publishing can seem intimidating. However, breaking the process down into manageable steps as provided in a free online checklist makes it very straightforward. Speaking from experience having self-published over 200 books on Amazon, one of the biggest lessons learned is focusing marketing efforts in a specific niche and promoting strategically. Taking the time upfront to identify the best audience to target and which promotional channels will be most effective helps maximize chances for success.

### Managing the Writing Self
We each have two parts - the logical self that does daily tasks, and the creative self that daydreams and writes. This second self is shy and sensitive, needing inspiration, quiet and purpose. Doing writing exercises without expectations allows this self to come out of hiding. 

Within all of us are two distinct aspects - the logical, practical self focused on responsibilities and the imaginative, creative self that fuels our artistic expression. This latter part of our identity is shy and sensitive in nature, needing inspiration, calm reflection, and intention to emerge. It's also easily discouraged by pressure or unrealistic expectations. By practicing writing techniques without attaching judgments, we nurture our creative spirit and encourage it to share freely. This helps overcome mental blocks that can inhibit the free flow of ideas.

## Finding the Spark
Returning to practices of paying close attention to the world around you and cultivating wonder will reveal moments worth writing about. These observations and experiences can then be explored more deeply through writing. Over time, this builds a rich source of material to draw from.

To regain our writing mojo when uninspired, it's beneficial to return to nurturing habits of active observation and open-minded curiosity. Really paying attention to details in our daily lives, conversations we overhear, or while out in nature frequently uncovers kernels of inspiration just begging to be expanded upon. Jotting them down allows us to revisit and explore these impressions more deeply through writing later. Over the long run, this cultivation of source material builds a well of ideas to pull from during drier spells of creativity.

## Just Start Writing
Having even a loose idea of where the story is headed prevents "blocks" - everything else is just a problem to solve along the way. Putting pen to paper is the best way to get unstuck. don't doubt yourself, just start and the words will come.

The magic cure for writer’s block is simply to start writing, even if you aren’t sure where things are headed. Having a general sense of direction is enough. Everything else you can figure out as you go. Put fingers to keyboard and type, scribble with pen on paper - the actions of writing itself will get the creative wheels turning again. Doubt and second-guessing will only hold you back more. Trust that if you just begin putting one word after the next, the flow of ideas and words will soon follow.
