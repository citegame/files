## ### Support for Strict Enforcement of Immigration Laws
My parents immigrated to the United States legally in the 1980s. They had to wait in long immigration lines and undergo extensive background checks and medical screenings. As someone who benefited from their journey, I understand the desire to follow proper legal processes. However, uncontrolled illegal immigration places undue burdens on taxpayers and stretches public services like healthcare and education. Most who enter the country illegally are low-skilled and may not significantly contribute economically. With drugs and criminals finding ways across the southern border, stronger border security is important.

## ### Negative Impacts of Illegal Immigration on Jobs and Wages
When undocumented immigrants take jobs, it can displace citizens and legal residents from the workforce. This excess labor supply also tends to lower wages for those at the bottom of the economic ladder. Though they fill important roles, employers gain an unfair advantage if they hire off-the-books workers and avoid minimum wage, overtime, and payroll tax laws. To protect jobs and uphold the rule of law, stricter penalties are needed for companies that knowingly hire illegal labor.

## ### A Personal Experience of Immigrating with an Aging Parent
A few years ago, my elderly mother's health took a turn for the worse back in our home country. With no other family nearby, I petitioned to bring her to America on a temporary visa so she could receive quality care. Though the visa expired, returning her abroad was not an option in her condition. I allowed her to overstay due to humanitarian reasons, even though it was technically illegal. She passed away peacefully here with loved ones at her bedside. While the law is the law, exceptions can be made out of compassion.

## ### Both Sides Have Valid Perspectives on a Complex Issue
A balanced discussion requires acknowledging nuances on both sides. thriving economies need a mix of skilled and low-skilled workers, and many undocumented immigrants contribute greatly while paying hundreds of millions in taxes each year. However, uncontrolled immigration strains public coffers and creates challenges enforcing border security and interior laws. Neither open borders nor a strict enforcement-only approach will solve the dilemma. Reasonable people of good faith can disagree on where to strike the right policy balance.

## ### Reforming the System to Balance Compassion and Rule of Law
Providing veterans and residents who have contributed for decades a pathway to earned legal status seems a fair solution. But continued amnesty incentives will not curb border crossings or change the underlying calculus driving illegal movement. At the same time, calls for draconian employer penalties or mass deportations are not realistic options in the real world and may do more societal harm than good. Incremental changes phasing in verification systems, modernizing visa programs, and targeted border technology could help stem the tide over time in a balanced way.

## ### The Role of Border Security and Interior Enforcement
Securing the border alone cannot resolve illegal immigration challenges. Most undocumented immigrants enter legally and overstay visas rather than cross unlawfully. Enhanced interior enforcement through E-Verify, cooperation with local authorities, and robust tracking exit systems are needed to curb the "pull factors." However, uncontrolled borders also enable dangerous transnational crimes like human trafficking and drug smuggling. A smart, systematic strategy using barriers, patrols, screening technology, and regional cooperation where appropriate forms part of a comprehensive solution.

## ### Conclusion
Compassion and national interests often clash in polarizing immigration debates with no clear political will for permanent reform. While border security matters, most analysts agree enforcement alone cannot transform 11 million residents overnight. Earned legalization through responsibility and restitution seems the most practical approach consistent with American values. Both restrictive and permissive positions have merits warranting thoughtful discussion toward balanced solutions protecting workers, families, public safety and the rule of law. Open and reasonable discussions—not accusations—are needed to forge common ground on this complex challenge.
