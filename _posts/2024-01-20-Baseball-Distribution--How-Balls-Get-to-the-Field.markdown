### Preparing the Game Balls
The home team is responsible for providing baseballs for each game. Before each game, they will rub up between 10-12 dozen balls with special mud. This process helps improve the grip on the ball for pitchers and batters. It also removes the shine from a new ball, making it easier for hitters to see against the sky. The mudding process conditions the ball's leather and gets it ready for game play.

### Inspecting and Approving the Supply
Once the balls are mudded and prepared, the home team presents them to the umpire for inspection before the game. The umpire will examine each ball closely to check for defects or issues. Any balls that don't pass muster are removed from the supply. The approved balls are then distributed to the pitchers as needed throughout the contest by the umpire. This ensures only high quality balls that meet regulations are used on the field.

### Replacing Damaged Balls  
As the game progresses, some balls will become unusable due to scuffing, discoloration, or damage sustained over the course of pitches and hits. The umpires diligently monitor each ball's condition. Whenever a ball no longer meets specifications, it is removed from play. Fresh replacement balls are taken from the home team's supply to take the damaged one's place. This keeps the on-field supply stocked with optimal balls.

### The Volume Used in a Single Game
On average, MLB games will go through 70 to 120 baseballs over the course of a nine inning regulation contest. Factors like the number of pitches thrown, foul balls put into play, home runs surrendered, and weather conditions all affect how many balls are needed. Having plenty of quality options on hand allows the flow of the game to continue smoothly.

### Supplying Away Games
While each home team prepares balls for their own hosted games, away clubs also carry backup balls with them on the road. If the home supply runs low during a close game, the visitors can provide additional high quality options from their traveling stock until more arrive from the home team's reserves. This ensures the game is never paused due to a lack of balls.

### Second Acts for Retired Game Balls
Not all game-used baseballs are permanently removed from circulation. Some scuffed balls deemed no longer suitable for MLB play still have roles to play. Teams may use mildly worn balls for batting practice sessions. Others are set aside as special mementos that players and fans prize as collection pieces. Many barely used balls also get donated to youth baseball leagues, allowing the next generation to enjoy America's pastime.

### Supplying a Whole Season  
To keep up with demand over a full MLB schedule, each club needs around 10,000 new baseballs just for home games and practices throughout the season. Plus hundreds or thousands more are required for dedicated batting and pitcher conditioning activities away from regulation contests. It's a massive volume, but ensures fresh balls are always on hand at every level of play.

### Ensuring a Smooth Contest
The careful preparation, oversight, replacement and logistics involved in supplying baseballs for each MLB game are key to protecting the integrity of competition. With approved, high quality balls ready when needed, the game's natural flow between pitchers and hitters can continue without disruption. It's a behind-the-scenes process that maintains baseball's tradition while looking out for player safety - the ultimate goal of any major sport.
